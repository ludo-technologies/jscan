When reporting, please include:

- A description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- The potential impact
- Any suggested fixes (if applicable)

## Response SLA

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours of the report being received.
- **Critical fixes**: Within 30 days for critical issues.

We will keep you informed of our progress as we work toward a resolution. Once the issue is fixed, we will coordinate disclosure with you.
